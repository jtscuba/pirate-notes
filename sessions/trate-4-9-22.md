# Summary

Washed up on the high seas after a close call with the leviathan, the party need to repair their ship. Meanwhile the leviathan had a run-in with the deutschland military leaving both parties battered.

## What does the party want

1. RNJesus wants to get on the good side of deutschland so he can woo Anastasia. 
2. Bryce wants his plant to grow sooner -> miracle grow?
3. Geer wants treasure, maybe also fame and secrets
4. Sam wants to cause damage
5. Dr. Doo wants to cause the slow collapse of human society

## Where do I want them to be

First I want them to hang out by the rocks for a while.

Set up to sneak aboard a Dutch military vessel that's towing the Ever Given, an enormous Deutschland military with a nasty habbit of getting stuck in unfortunate places.

## How do I connect what I want with what they want

1.

2. Captain Ortaka and a smattering of the crew managed to slip off in a life boat while the leviathin was ravaging the ship. He'll find the party while they're riding out the massive storms and fog left behind in the aftermath of the Deutschland battle and offer them a proposition. Help him retrieve the admiral and loot the dutch ship in exchange for whatever gold they can keep and a commendation from Deutschland.
