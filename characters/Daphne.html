<p>Thanks to Daphne's noble birth, people are inclined to think the best of her. She is welcome in high society, and people assume she has the right to be wherever she is. The common folk make every effort to accommodate her and avoid her displeasure, and other people of high birth treat her as a member of the same social sphere. She can secure an audience with a local noble if she needs to.</p>
