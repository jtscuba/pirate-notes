<p>Those who look into Dr. Doo's eyes can see that he has faced unimaginable horror and that he is no stranger to darkness. Though they might fear him, commoners will extend him every courtesy and do their utmost to help him. Unless he has shown himself to be a danger to them, they will even take up arms to fight alongside him, should he find himself facing an enemy alone.</p>
