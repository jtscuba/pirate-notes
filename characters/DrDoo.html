<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>A calm demeanor and sophisticated appearance belie the feral beast lying just below the surface. With each passing day he gets more in touch with his heritage, and as he does he gets less and less in control.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Curse of All Squashes</h2>
<p>Hunted by darkness, the squatches hide on the material plane, biding their time. When young squaches leave on their spirit journeys, that is when they're most vulnerable. Out in the world, alone that is when the darkness comes for them.</p>
<p>Those who look into Dr. Doo's eyes can see that he has faced unimaginable horror and that he is no stranger to darkness. Though they might fear him, commoners will extend him every courtesy and do their utmost to help him. Unless he has shown himself to be a danger to them, they will even take up arms to fight alongside him, should he find himself facing an enemy alone.</p>
