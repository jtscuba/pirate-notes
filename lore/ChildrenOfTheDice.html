<p>The core fundamental tenet of this faith is an unerring faith in the concept of randomness. Adherents of this faith believe that there is a constant sense of randomness which underpins the known physics of the universe. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The religion is agnostic towards magic; however, they believe that magic is just a byproduct of the random processes of the universe. Divine magic falls into this as well, they believe that deities were formed from the fundamental randomness of the universe and thus their preferred deity Pandemonium, or Pan for short.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When adherents of this religion die they believe that they are returned to the randomness of the universe. It should be noted that adherents, known as Children of the Dice , are not very concerned with spirituality, instead preferring to allow other more minor gods to take that role. Spirituality is neither discouraged or encouraged and each Child is allowed to worship other gods as they so wish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This religion has standard practices in terms of congregation and religious iconography; however, the way in which Children of the Dice elect their religious leaders is quite notable. At the beginning of the year the entire congregation gathers and among them they roll dice, with the higher the number determining the position of that member in the ecclisiastical hierarchy. Anyone at the ceremony is allowed to roll the dice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The role of the head of the congregation is to present the scripture, usually through weekly recitation. The central law of the religion being randomness and this is reflected through the scripture presented at that time, chosen of course at random. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The leaders of the congregation Children of the Dice, known as Gamblers, are responsible for ensuring the scriptures are followed. Trial is carried out by coin flip and, if guilty, sent to spin the wheel if punishment.</p>
